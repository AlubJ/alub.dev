I originally wanted to make a simple space shooter game but the engine just kept growing with features to the point where it's a semi-decent (2000's esque) game engine renderer.\n\n## What are Calico's features?\nThere isn't too much to Calico right now. Currently it can render simple scenes using some PBR textures like the diffuse texture, normal texture, specular texture and cubemap texture for reflections. The engine can also do simple shadow mapping, but has yet to have percentage-closer filtering to make the shadows look better.\n\n## Why is it called Calico Engine?\nI don't know, cool name I suppose.\n\n## Calico Editor\nHere is the editor in its current state.\n\n<video width='100%' height='auto' controls><source src='https://i.imgur.com/dlhIg8a.mp4' type='video/mp4'></video>",
